							<h1> SIMON: The Magnus Opus</h1>
							<P id="two">
								Up until recently, I've wanted to make a comic with cool characters people could relate to or either find solace in. Despite the series eventually becoming something of a Battle Odyssey and focusing less on the human aspect, I still wanted to tell a story of hardships and resilience. SIMON will be the ultimate Web Comic. I've had many iterations of the series fail due to my lacking art skills and storytelling at the time of its inception back in 2020. Now that I've had time to grow a bit, I feel I can make a product worth people's time...

							<h1> The Ten hundred Blog</h1>
							<P id="two">
								The story of TEN HUNDRED follows the adventures of a little Monkey Boy named 
						Bunavelle who has been tasked with taking back the Powers of the Oath Keepers from The Lost Ones. 
						These sacred powers that are bestowed to the Covenant Holders turns ordinary mortals into Gods.

							<h1> Who Am I? Introductions and Such </h1>
							<P id="two">
								Yo. I'm Sane, Sane the Geek, and welcome to my little hangout space. I'm an Artist-Illustrator that dabbles in a ton of avenues of Art and technology, such as Web Development, programming, Digital Illustration, and Web Comic Production. I've been doing this for quite a while now, ever since I was in the second grade, and I'm 27 now. I haven't had any commercial work or offers, probably because my art isn't really that good yet, but I have gotten a few commissions in the past. I'm 6'6, weight...a lot, and love anime and cartoons.

							<h1> The Spice & Co. Blog </h1>
							<P id="two">
								Spice and Co. follows the lives of 2 high schoolers named Vincent Nickels and Lucy Omni as they get to know each other and come to term with their struggles. The story isn't really all that unique, I mean it's just another slife of life love story, but the way that I'm telling it - I feel will draw people to it once it finally releases on webtoon canvas. Most love stories on the platform have unbearable characters or the quality drops off significantly from going on a little longer than need be. I plan on ending the series after about, I wanna say around 60 episodes spanning 3 seasons, but It could end sooner or later, who knows really.
