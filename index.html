							<h1> SIMON: The Magnus Opus</h1>
							<P id="two">
								Up until recently, I've wanted to make a comic with cool characters people could relate to or either find solace in. Despite the series eventually becoming something of a Battle Odyssey and focusing less on the human aspect, I still wanted to tell a story of hardships and resilience. SIMON will be the ultimate Web Comic. I've had many iterations of the series fail due to my lacking art skills and storytelling at the time of its inception back in 2020. Now that I've had time to grow a bit, I feel I can make a product worth people's time...

							<h1> Who Am I? Introductions and Such </h1>
							<P id="two">
								Yo. I'm Sane, Sane the Geek, and welcome to my little hangout space. I'm an Artist-Illustrator that dabbles in a ton of avenues of Art and technology, such as Web Development, programming, Digital Illustration, and Web Comic Production. I've been doing this for quite a while now, ever since I was in the second grade, and I'm 27 now. I haven't had any commercial work or offers, probably because my art isn't really that good yet, but I have gotten a few commissions in the past. I'm 6'6, weight...a lot, and love anime and cartoons.
