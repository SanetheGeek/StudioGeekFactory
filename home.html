							<h1> SIMON: The Magnus Opus</h1>
							<P id="two">
								Up until recently, I've wanted to make a comic with cool characters people could relate to or either find solace in. Despite the series eventually becoming something of a Battle Odyssey and focusing less on the human aspect, I still wanted to tell a story of hardships and resilience. SIMON will be the ultimate Web Comic. I've had many iterations of the series fail due to my lacking art skills and storytelling at the time of its inception back in 2020. Now that I've had time to grow a bit, I feel I can make a product worth people's time...

							<h1> SPICE and CO: Friends, Adventures, and Tasty Treats!</h1>
							<P id="two">
								Ah yes, Spice and Co., another one of my comics I plan on working on in tandem with SIMON and TEN HUNDRED. I initially started working on a pilot episode back in 2023, but never got around to finishing it due to the immense workload SIMON had become. The story details the lives of 2 friends, Lucy Omni and Vincent Nickels, who own a small diner in the inner city. Together, they travel the Universe in search of rare foods and ingredients to add to their little establishment. I won't go into too much detail, as to not spoil the story, but it is a Slice of Life - Romance comic with a little action thrown in there. And, the world is interconnected with SIMON's...

							<h1> The Ten hundred Blog</h1>
							<P id="two">
								So, Ten Hundred, a strange name for what is essentially a Super Mario Bros. clone. I've had this idea for a couple of months now, and wanted to turn it into a comic and eventually a video game. The premise revolves around a young boy who goes by the name of Ten Hundred. He fights these unique little creatures I'm calling The Irregulars who have infested The Land of Crumbs. Ten Hun goes around and does little "house cleaning," acquiring collectables, solving puzzles, rescuing civilians, before coming face to face with The Ink Maker, basically the ultimate boss of the series...

							<h1> Who Am I? Introductions and Such </h1>
							<P id="two">
								Yo. I'm Sane, Sane the Geek, and welcome to my little hangout space. I'm an Artist-Illustrator that dabbles in a ton of avenues of Art and technology, such as Web Development, programming, Digital Illustration, and Web Comic Production. I've been doing this for quite a while now, ever since I was in the second grade, and I'm 27 now. I haven't had any commercial work or offers, probably because my art isn't really that good yet, but I have gotten a few commissions in the past. I'm 6'6, weight...a lot, and love anime and cartoons.
