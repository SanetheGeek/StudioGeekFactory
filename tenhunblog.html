						So, Ten Hundred, a strange name for what is essentially a Super Mario Bros. clone. I've had this idea for a couple of months now, and wanted to turn it into a comic and eventually a video game. The premise revolves around a young boy who goes by the name of Ten Hundred. He fights these unique little creatures I'm calling The Irregulars who have infested The Land of Crumbs. Ten Hun goes around and does little "house cleaning," acquiring collectables, solving puzzles, rescuing civilians, before coming face to face with The Ink Maker, basically the ultimate boss of the series. 
						<br>
						<br>
						The inspiration comes 2 sources, the main being the aforementioned Super Mario Bros. The other is Minecraft. I'm not really sure how I'm going to pull off making a full game by myself. If SIMON does well, and makes me enough money, I'll probably hire a small team of devs to help me bring the video game aspect to life. As far as the comic goes, I'll most likely start producing it side by side with SIMON during its later seasons. 
						<br>
						<br>
						So, let's talk about the ideas I have about Ten Hundred starting with the comic. I'm thinking of making it a short series, something light just to pass the time since SIMON takes a lot of work. I'm thinking about producing maybe around 50 or so episodes, maybe even 100. There's not really a defined amount of episodes one can predict a series can have before it's even a thing. If the story allows, it can go up to 200 episodes. Speaking of the episodes, they will most likely be short as well. I have a loose idea of what I want to do. I'm just hoping the readers will like it. 
						<br>
						<br>
						Taking inspiration from Mario Bros and Minecraft, of course the enemies are going to be unique. The Irregulars are sentient drawings made from a magical ink and brush weilded by The Ink Maker. The brushes name is called Brew, an ancient relic passed down from The Ink Maker's family for generations. Although, it's never been used for evil purposes, until now. The Ink Maker's desire is a simple one, become the sole ruler over The Land of Crumbs. To do that, he plans on turning everyone into an Irregular through the magical ink and brush. Ten Hun must use the powers he acquires throughout the series in order to take him down. And that's about it for the comic. 
						<br>
						<br>
						For the game, there's a TON of ideas circling around my head. 1st, The land of Crumbs will have 13 iconic locations, 12 being the main levels, and 1 reserved for the final boss. You will have to collect these Giant Diamond Keys as the main collectable in order to move on to the next level. You will be solving puzzles in order to acquire the Golden Chess Pieces, which will act as keys to open Tombs and Dungeons. As fare as secondary collectable goes for One Ups, I'm thinking about having you collect either Coins or Jewels. There's going to be an inventory system, a food/recipe system, powers ups and techniques, and so much more. It'll be a digitally painted 3D game with 2D elements. 
						<br>
						<br>
						And that's about it for the blog. Thanks for reading. I have HUGE plans for this series and I'm hoping with the success of SIMON, I can get everything off the ground.
