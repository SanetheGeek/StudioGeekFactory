						Yo. I'm Sane, Sane the Geek, and welcome to my little hangout space. I'm an Artist-Illustrator that dabbles in a ton of avenues of Art and technology, such as Web Development, programming, Digital Illustration, 2D Animation, 3D Sculpting, and Web Comic Production. I've been doing this for quite a while now, ever since I was in the second grade, and I'm 27 now. I haven't had any commercial work or offers, probably because my art isn't really that good yet, but I have gotten a few commissions in the past. I'm 6'6, weigh...a lot, and love anime and cartoons.
						<br>
						<br>
						Growing up, I loved to draw, although during those times, as you can imagine, my art was absolutely terrible. I did start off drawing stick figures, but I added a little spice to them by using basic shapes to try and give it form. I didn't have a teacher to teach me these things, so I essentially learned by trial and error. We also didn't officially get a computer with internet till I was about 14-15 years old. This was back in 2012. Or well, we had internet back in 2009, but didn't get the computer until 3 years later. That computer would last for about 5 years until...I broke it. Damaged the Hard Drive pretty badly and it wouldn't boot up. 
						<br>
						<br>
						Anyways, I graduated from High School in 2015, and decided not to go to college because reasons. There was actually a period of time where I didn't even draw, from 2015 up until 2017. During 2017, I was trying to rebrand my OG OC SIMON (originally named Aaron, Rex, Brash, and Kino...he went through a lot of name changes) as Shun the Dog. I liked the design, even used it for a bit, before ultimately scrapping it, and never using it again actually. During the peak of covid in 2020, I discovered Webtoon and used the original design for the Web Comic SIMON.
						<br>
						<br>
						I'm still learning about a ton of things when it comes to Art, such as Perspective, Color Theory, Rendering Techniques, Backgrounds both simple and detailed, and how to market myself as an artist. I especially suck at perspective and marketing myself, but I'll get there. I don't read as often as I should, but I do like to do it every now and then. For the time being, since I actually don't know where my books went, I substituted them for Audiobooks. Favorite subject is probably Math and History, even though I suck at math, and my memory isn't good enough to remember a lot of what I learned in history, but I still enjoy them. 
						<br>
						<br>
						I've developed a ton of projects over the years, some successful, some that haven't seen the light of day yet, some that has failed miserably. I haven't really been able to grow an audience, probably because my Art isn't really all over the internet yet. I'm not really a proponent of social media, but I realize how important it can be when you play to their algorithms, something I have no desire of doing. The last thing I want to talk about is my love for creation. I just really like making things, which is why Studio Geek Factory exists. I get to go into so many things and learn so much. It's been amazing. Not once when I was younger did I ever see myself developing video games, dabbling in 2D animation, practicing 3D sculpting, and Programming of all things. It takes a TON of patience and time, and I'm willing to put in the work to get better.
