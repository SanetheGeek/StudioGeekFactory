						<p>
							What's up? My name is Tyrell Johnson. My friends call me Sane, however. I am a freelance Artist-Illustrator, Writer, and 
							Web Comic creator based in Dallas, TX. I've worked on a ton of personal projects that you may or may not have heard of, such 
							as SIMON and SPICE & CO. I've dabbled in a bit of Game Development as well, although it's not a strong point of mine. I've also 
							dabbled in a bit of 2D animation, but alas, it's another weakpoint. Very tedious work with an appreciation for those who
							has the time and skill in order to make those amazing sakuga animations in anime. 
							<br>
							<br>
							Right now, I am 27. I've dipped my toes in a slew of projects but none have seen much of the light of day yet. I do have a YouTube
							channel, which is dedicated to my more professional Abstract Works, while what little socials I have are dedicated to my Comic 
							illustrations. I have 2 games I'm developing right now, GUN GLUTTONS 2D, and SIMON FIGHTERS. Both are on hiatus until I am able to 
							hire someone to help with the code as I don't have much experience with Unity or C#. I haven't been hired for professiona work, and I 
							don't think I care to be hired for such work. 
							<br>
							<br>
							As of now, I am just working on one thing at a time, SPICE & CO. being my main focus for the time being and probably the next couple 
							years. I have a ton of cool ideas I think, and would like to bring them to life someday, but for now, to minimize my jumping around 
							from one thing to another, I'm just working on one project in full until it's time for me to move on to the next thing.
