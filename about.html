							<h1> About Sane</h1>
							<p> Yo! My name is Tyrell Johnson, but my friends call me Sane the Geek. I am the creator of Studio Geek Factory, a small, one man team that delves into multiple avenues of Art and technology ranging from Illustration, Programming, Music, Web Development, Game Development, Web Comics, animation, and 3D Sculpting. 
							<br>
							<br>
							I've been making art since the early 2000s and have been refining my skills and style over the past 15+ years. There's still a lot I need to learn about, and I'm more than willing to learn so long as it's presented in a fun and educational manner. Currently, I haven't worked in the mainstream industry and I don't think I plan on doing so. I like having the freedom to do what I want. 
							<br>
							<br>
							Some of the projects that I've worked on are JIGGLYTOONZ, now defunct, JIGGLYWAIFUS, a better, more developed version of JIGGYTOONZ, which is on a long hiatus. SIMON, my web comic series that's been in development hell since 2020. SPICE & CO., an Adventure-Romance comic that I'm working on, Dr. Sane, a comedy based web comic I'm also working on. Gun Gluttons, my 1st 2D collectathon shoot-em-up platformer game, and countless 2D Illustrations.
