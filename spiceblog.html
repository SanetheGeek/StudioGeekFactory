						Spice and Co. follows the lives of 2 high schoolers named Vincent Nickels and Lucy Omni as they get to know each other and come to term with their struggles. The story isn't really all that unique, I mean it's just another slife of life love story, but the way that I'm telling it - I feel will draw people to it once it finally releases on webtoon canvas. Most love stories on the platform have unbearable characters or the quality drops off significantly from going on a little longer than need be. I plan on ending the series after about, I wanna say around 60 episodes spanning 3 seasons, but It could end sooner or later, who knows really.

                        While not being my "Magnum Opus" series, I do intend for it to leave a lasting mark on the readers before proceeding on with SIMON. I've wanted to tell this story for a while now, ever since 2020 when I found out about Webtoon, but I was fairly new to digital art at the time, didn't know how to color, layer, and all that fancy jazz, and my drawing skills weren't really passable during those horrid years. Thankfully, some awesome people egged me on to get better at art recently, even gave me some critiques and tips and what not, and I've been studying ever since.

                        In order for this comic to do well, I feel it needs to be aesthetically pleasing to the eye. The way I'm achieving this is by not over rendering the characters, using bright, saturated colors, cel shading, and colored line work, amongst other things. For the backgrounds, I tend to use painterly brushes with texture to try and mimic that tactile feel of paint on textured paper. If I had a team, I'd probably use actual paintings on A4 paper in order to achieve better results, but alas, I am poor, and that'd be quite a bit of work, but it wouldn't be completely out of the equation.

                        Spice & Co. will be a testament to my writing, drawing, and storytelling capabilities. I'm doing something completely different from what I normally do, which is Action with lots of blood in it like SIMON, or Gag comics such as 'The Wonderful World of Sane,' which has a lot of 4th wall breaks and jokes. Since SIMON has been shelved for the time being, I have Spice & Co. releasing in its place on March 4th of 2026. It'll be a momentus day, but until then, I have a lot of work to do.
